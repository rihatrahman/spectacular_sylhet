<h2>Sreemangal</h2>
</div>
<p>Despite being an Upazilla, a small administrative unit, under Moulvibazar district in Sylhet, Sreemongol has long been credited as a top tourist attraction having earned its recognition as a town as early as the beginning of the19th century. Even though the first ever tea garden in Sylhet, Malnichara, was established near Sylhet city in 1854, large tea estates eventually found their niche in Sreemongol town and the surrounding hills and mountains. The only tea research institute in Bangladesh, BTRI, which is a popular tourist destination is also situated in this town. Easily accessible from Dhaka by road or train, Sreemongol has a lot to offer for tourists. Of the 138 tea gardens in Greater Sylhet, 38 are situated in Sreemongol, and this number would be no fewer than 60 when added to gardens in the surrounding areas.
Anyone travelling in and around Sreemongol is sure to be greeted by lush green tea gardens that stretch over miles and miles of hilly areas, not to speak of the chirping birds and shading trees besides the pineapple and lemon gardens.</p>
