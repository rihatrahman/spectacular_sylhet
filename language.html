<p>Although Sylhet is a part of Bangladesh, the spoken dialect dialect in Sylhet is much different than <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language">Bengali</a>, the national language of Bangladesh. Sylheti is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh and Barak Valley of the Indian state of Assam. There is also a substantial number of Sylheti speakers in the Indian states of Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur, and Nagaland. It also has a large diaspora in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Middle East. It is the third most spoken dialect in United Kingdom after English and Polish. The high influx of Middle Eastern and Central Asian settlers led to an influence from Arabic and Persian on Sylheti. Sylhet also has its own alphabet named <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylheti_Nagari">Nagari lipi</a> comprising of 32 letters.The specific origin of Sylheti Nagari is debated. The script has also been known as Jalalabadi Nagari. The specific origin of Sylheti Nagari is debated. The general hypothesis is the Muslims of Sylhet were the ones to invent it. There is also belief that <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jalal">Shah Jalal R.W.</a> brought the script with him when he arrived in the area in the 13th century.</p>
